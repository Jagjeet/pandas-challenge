# pandas-challenge

This project analyzes the Heroes of Pymoli data. For more information see the individual areas of analysis in the `HeroesOfPymoli.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook. A final analysis including observations (3) can be found in the last cell of the notebook.

## Prerequisites

To run this project the following tools are needed:

* Python (tested with v3.85, earlier versions may work as well, but have not been tested)
* Jupyter Notebooks and/or Jupyter Labs

## Usage

Clone the respository and open and run the `HeroesOfPymoli.ipynb` from Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Labs.

Analysis can be viewed in the individual cells.

## Known Issues

* In some cases data from previous Jupyter cells are used to calculate values in the current cell. As such make sure to run all above cells to obtain the correct output
